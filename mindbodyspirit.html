<p style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;"> The Mind, Body, Soul Project challenged me to create images that depict my being from my own point of view.  Initially I thought that the hardest point may be to create the images but in the end the hardest aspect was to know myself and to reflect the points that I felt were most important. The work was to be created using non-destructive software and found images, these ideas went along with the current concepts that we have discussed in our Lectures, specifically New Media Art and Copyright.
    I presented myself in my work by trying to reach a little bit in and genuinely reflect on myself including pieces of who I am as well as who I want to be or the strides I am making to become myself. Firstly we will see my Mind Image which has come to be my favorite image, I want to highlight this kind of internal conflict as well as growth and building. When the viewer looks at this image it may have a bit of Juxtaposition but realistically that is a true aspect of who I am because while im free like a bird i’m also busy like a crowded city but in the midst of all of that I continue to grow. Secondly the Viewer will see my image that depicts my Body and in my opinion this was the hardest concept to portray because my body is something that everyone see and I wanted it to be more personal but that wasn’t really something I could do without presenting the achy feelings I have through shattered glass of the way that I feel my body is fruitful because of the wonderful things it does and will continue to do for me. I think that my body Image will allow the viewer to use their own interpretation like why did I use a bed or why did I stray so far from the style of my first image. The final image in the set depicts my spirit and I genuinely expected this to be my favorite picture because I had cool picture Ideas but after a lot of thinking and moving images around I still felt the strongest connection to my mind image. I think that It’s interesting that my spirit image was less accurate to me than my mind image because I feel like it’s accurate in the way that I know myself and my self reflection.
    I believe that all of my pieces fit together no matter if they look similar or different because all of my images depict me and there’s many different aspects of me. The images fall into a cohesive set in the biggest way because of the outside, inside, outside aspect that I didn’t strive for initially but really loved in the final product. I also feel that these fit together just because they are my style of brainstorm and I see myself in my style and image choice. In the end I hope that my pieces show a bit of myself to those that view them and if they do/don’t do that I’m hopeful that the viewers enjoys looking at them.
